Triage engine
=============

* Detect hangs

* CReduced cases are now treated as if the llvm/clang versions don't
  affect them (the versions used are stored in the database, but
  nothing is done with them). Figure out the right way of using it.

* Whenever there is a new failure, remove that case from
  creduced_cases if the previous result is 'no_crash', triggering new
  reduce.

* A more language-agnostic and clang-dependent way of reducing test
  cases, in addition to creduce?

* Do the triage runs in parallel

* Write code to tell apart creduce failure from failure in our
  property check script?

* More controlled report generation instead of the current
  update-hook.sh

Report
======

* Do not show all runs from the beginning of time, but do something
  more clever

* Show failed reduces?

Tools
=====

* Make import tool accept s/h/sha1 directory hierarchies like those
  generated by the export tools

Misc
====

* Also import cases other than those that once crashed, striving for
  maximum coverage?

* Also import those of the cases that afl designated as hangs that
  actually are hangs

* Test framework
